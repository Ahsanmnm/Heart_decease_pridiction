## Overview

This web application allows users to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient details. It uses a machine learning model trained on a Kaggle dataset. The model was evaluated using Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms, and KNN was chosen for the final model used in this web application.

## Features

- User-friendly web interface for entering patient details.
- Real-time prediction of heart disease likelihood.
- Dark mode toggle for better user experience.
- Accuracy comparison of Random Forest and KNN models.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd heart-disease-prediction-web
